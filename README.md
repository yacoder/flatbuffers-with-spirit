Google flatbuffers implementation using Boost.Spirit.

Not yet stable.

# How to build

- Install biicode.
- Install CMake.
- Clone repo.
- `bii init` in the repo folder
- `bii configure` with the right parameters (see *.cmd for examples, but you may need to change paths in there)
- `bii build` (or build from VS or CLion using the files produced in the previous step)
- run, all test cases should pass

P.S. you may need to update BII_PROJECT_ROOT in CMakeLists.txt
